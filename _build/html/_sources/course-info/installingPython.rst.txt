Installing Python
=================

**In order to complete the tutorials and exercises, you should download a python distribution on your own computer.**  While the Mac computers in the campus computer labs have python installed on them, these versions may not have some of the packages that we will use in this course. The purpose of this page is to help you to
install Python and different Python packages into your own computer. While it is possible to install Python from the Python homepage https://www.python.org/,
**we highly recommend using** `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ which is an open source distribution of the Python and R programming
languages for large-scale data processing and scientific computing. Anaconda combines a basic python distribution with many packages that are commonly used to do science. This makes life a lot easier for us, the users, in the
long run.

Install Python on Windows
-------------------------

Following steps should work on all Windows 7 and 10 computers.

`Download Anaconda installer (64 bit) <https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.10-Windows-x86_64.exe>`_ for Windows.

Install Anaconda to your computer by double clicking the installer and install it into a directory you want (you will need admin privileges).
If promped, install it to **all users** and use default settings.

Test that AnacondaÂ´s package manager called ``conda`` works by
opening a command prompt as a admin user (http://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-8.1/)
and running the command ``conda --version``. If the command returns a version number of conda (e.g. ``conda 4.5.9``) everything is working correctly.

The ``conda`` command is used to install packages that
were not included with the...

Install Python on macOS
-----------------------

OSX users can visit `the Anaconda downloads page <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section>`__ and click to download the latest 64-Bit Graphical Installer for the Python 3 version of Anaconda.

Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Anaconda using the default options.

Then, open up the Terminal application and enter ``conda --version`` to
verify a correct installation.

    You probably want the graphical option, but you do you.

Updating
--------

Once you start using Anaconda or the Spyder IDE, you
may get the occasional "software needs updating" dialog
box popping up. Updating is easy from the Command prompt
(windows) or Terminal (Mac). Simply execute the command
``conda update spyder`` and follow the instructions.
