Python Vocabulary
=================

For reference, a few common terms that will be used throughout
this course.

* **Variable**: a way of storing values into the memory of the computer
  by using specific names that you define.
* **Script**:  a document that contains your Python code
  that you
  can execute. Python script files should always
  have the ``.py`` file extension.
* **Index**: the **location** of specific value stored in
  Python lists, arrays, or tuples. Not the value itself.
  The first index value of list is always 0.
* **Data types**

    * Integer (int) = Whole number
    * Float (float) = Decimal number
    * String (str) = Text
    * Boolean (bool) = True / False
    * List (list) = A “container” that can store any kind of values.
      You can create a list with square brackets e.g.
      ``[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']``.
    * Tuple (tuple) = A similar “container” as list
      with a difference that you cannot update the
      values in a tuple. You can create a tuple with
      parentheses ``(1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')``.

* **Prompt**: The input area in the Anaconda Graphical
  User Interface (GUI) used to test single lines of
  code or interact with your code.
* **Argument**: Information that the computer needs
  to perform commands or execute functions.
* **Module**: Software that is not part of the
  base python distribution that needs to be
  imported before it can be used.
