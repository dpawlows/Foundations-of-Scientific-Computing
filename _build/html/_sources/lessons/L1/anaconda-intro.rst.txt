Anaconda basics
===============

The IDE
-------

The Anaconda package that you installed comes with
several different tools to help you be an efficient
programmer. To get started, launch Anaconda Navigator
from the Start Menu on Windows or from the Finder
on Mac. Once the Navigator is started, you will see
something like the image below:

    :align: center
    :alt: navigator startup screen

Where you can choose which tool to work with. JupyterLab
and Jupyter Notebooks are web based tools for
integrating Python code with human readable text and
graphics. These are extremely useful tools for sharing
analyses quickly, but we won't be using them here. If you
are interested, you can learn more about these tools at
https://jupyter.org/.

Spyder
------

In this course, we will be using the Spyder IDE, so launch
Spyder to get started. Note that you can quickly launch
Spyder by typing ``spyder`` in the Command Prompt (windows)
or Terminal (Mac).
