Grading for exercises
---------------------

Grades for assignments will be issued on a modified
5 point scale:

* 5 (Excellent; A)
* 4 (Good; B)
* 3 (Satisfactory; C)
* 2 (Acceptable; D)
* 0 (Fail; F 0%)

Equivalent letter grades are shown for reference.

.. note:: Deadlines for each of the exercises will be
          provided each week and are firm. If you anticipate that you
          will be unable to submit an exercise by a given deadline,
          you must let me know by at least one day prior to the
          deadline. Late assignments will be marked down 25% per day late.
