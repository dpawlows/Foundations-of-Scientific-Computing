Welcome to Phy280!
===================

The Foundations of Scientific Computing course is meant to introduce you to some basic concepts of scientific computing using the Python programming language. Python is a tool that is used
extensively in the science and engineering fields, as well as data science, computer science,
web development fields, to name a few. It is assumed that you do not have prior
experience with python or programming in general, but if you do, you should expect
to build on these existing skill sets.

Each lesson will be delivered in a tutorial format so that you can follow along at the pace that best suits you. Then,
each lesson will be accompanied by an exercise set so
that you can test out your new understanding.

The goal of this course is not to make you expert computer programmers in one semester.  Instead, you should learn that computing is an incredibly powerful and necessary tool, and, you will develop a basic set of skills that will be useful in facilitating learning throughout your career at EMU.

Course topics by week
