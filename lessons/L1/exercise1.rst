Exercise 1
==========

Two goals for this first assignment: 1) Create an account on GitHub.com
and 2) start working with python.

Part 1- GitHub
--------------

1. Open a browser and go to `<https://github.com/>`_.

      :align: center
      :alt: github

2. Once there, click **Sign up** in the upper right corner and follow the instructions.
3. Choose the free option when you are prompted to select a plan.
   You will get access to private repositories as part of
   the exercises in this
   course. If you create *your own* repositories, they will be
   publicly visible.
4. Finish the other steps as appropriate.
5. Once you have a GitHub account, post your GitHub username to the
   appropriate discussion on the Canvas shell for this course.

Part 2- Basic Python
--------------------

1. Now that you have a GitHub account, head to
`<https://classroom.github.com/a/Qt12O-mk>`_ to get access to the
rest of the assignment. When you accept the assignment, a private
GitHub repository will be created for you. You can then follow the
instructions in the repository to complete
the assignment and then upload your files to your own repository
when you are finished.
