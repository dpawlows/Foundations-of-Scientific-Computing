2. Once there, if you don't already have an account, click **Sign up** in the upper right corner.
3. Finish the other steps as appropriate to create an account.
4. Once you have a GitHub account, post your GitHub username to the
   appropriate discussion on the Canvas shell for this course.

Part 2- Basic Python
--------------------

1. Now that you have a GitHub account, head to
`<https://classroom.github.com/a/OMJcurau>`_ to get access to the
rest of the assignment. When you accept the assignment, a private
GitHub repository will be created for you. You can then follow the
instructions in the repository to complete
the assignment and then upload your files to your own repository
when you are finished.
