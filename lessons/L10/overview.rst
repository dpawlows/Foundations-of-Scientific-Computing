Lesson Overview
===============

In this lesson we will learn about another useful python module:
`Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_. Pandas gives us access
to a few new tools that make reading, manipulating, understanding, and
writing data much easier and more efficient.

The focus of this lesson is on:

1. `An introduction to Pandas and the Series and DataFrame data types <pandas.ipynb>`_
2. `How to use Data Frames to do basic tasks with your data <dataframe.ipynb>`_
