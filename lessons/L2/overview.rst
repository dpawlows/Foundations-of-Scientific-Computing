This week, we will continue to build an understanding of
some of the fundamental concepts behind programming in
python including getting familiar with the list datatype. You will
also learn a little about the concept of object oriented programming.

The components of this lesson are:

1. `Some more python basics <basics.ipynb>`_
2. `Working with the list datatype <lists.ipynb>`_
3. :doc:`Best practices: documenting your code <coding>`

Learning Goals
--------------

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

* determine the datatype of a variable
* perform data type conversions
* have more control over the `print()` function
* create and access elements of a list
* differentiate between a list index and its corresponding value
