    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power behind computer programming is the ability to make the computer \n",
    "do repetative tasks. In python, we can do this using two tools: \n",
    "**for** and **while** loops. The general idea is: let's say we have a set of instructions that we want the computer to execute more than once. We can place \n",
    "those instructions inside a `for` or a `while` loop and the computer will \n",
    "execute the commands some set number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we work with some examples, it's important to grasp the difference between\n",
    "the two types of loops. A `for` loop executes the instructions a set number of \n",
    "times based on iterating over a sequence. A `while` loop will do the same thing \n",
    "execpt instead of iterating over a sequence, it will repeat execution of the \n",
    "instructions as long as a specific condition is met. \n",
    "\n",
    "For loops\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, the generic syntax of a for loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    for element in iterable:\n",
    "        instruction 1\n",
    "        instruction 2\n",
    "        instruction 3\n",
    "        etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "    continue program flow outside of for loop\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Three important syntax things to note. First, the for loop definition (the first line) starts with the special word \"for\" and ends with a colon. Second, the \n",
    "instructions that we want to repeat begin after the definition line and are indented. Each instruction must be indented by the same number of spaces or tabs.\n",
    "Any code that goes back to the indentation level of the `for` definition itself \n",
    "will not be repeated by that loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iterables\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `for` loop in python requires something called an iterable. \n",
    "Iterables are a class of variables that have a specific behavior: you can \n",
    "iterate over them. You've already met 2 examples of these: character strings and \n",
    "lists. Let's look at an example:\n"
