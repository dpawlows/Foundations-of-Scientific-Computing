Lesson Overview
===============

Now that we've learned about lists, we can
start to talk about how we can use computers
to really do some of the repetative tasks
that makes programming so useful. We'll also talk
about the concept of an iterable in python,
a class of datatypes of which the list is one.
Finally, you will learn the basics of version
control using git.

The components of this lesson are:
