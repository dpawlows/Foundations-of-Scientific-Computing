Exercise 3
==========

This week, instead of downloading the files
that you need from GitHub, you will clone the
repository that is created when you accept the assignment.
To do that, first accept the assignment by going to
`<https://classroom.github.com/a/6bLAIheH>`_.

Once you've accepted the assignment, click on "Clone or Download"
button and copy the URL to your GitHub repository. Next,
use a Terminal session via Jupyter Lab to clone the
repository using the `git clone` command as described in
:ref:`using_git`.

This should result in the creation of a local repository
on your computer. You should follow the instructions
in the readme to complete the assignment. Then when you
are finished, use the :ref:`git workflow<git_workflow>` to commit your changes
locally and push them to your remote repository on GitHub
where I can access them.

.. note:: If you are ever working on an assignment and you have
          an issue and would like my help, please make sure that
          you have committed your changes and pushed them to
          GitHub before you send me an email. That way, I can
          see what you are working on and where the issue is, and
          even make comments right in your code.
