Exercise 3
==========

This week, we are going to start using git in the way that 
it was intended and in the way that it is used in the software development
field. Instead of downloading the files
that you need from GitHub as you have been doing, you will **clone** the
repository that is created when you accept the assignment using the terminal. Please 
learn how to do this! **If you are having trouble, make sure you talk to me.** 
To start, first accept the assignment by going to
`<https://classroom.github.com/a/mQdsPG02>`_.

Once you've accepted the assignment, click on the "Code"
button and make sure the "SSH" tab is selected. Then 
copy the link that shows in the text box (for example, mine is 
git@github.com:emuphysics/exercise03-dpawlows.git). Next,
use the Terminal, Jupyter Lab, or Windows Powershell to clone the
repository using the `git clone` command as described in
:ref:`using_git`.

This should result in the creation of a local repository
on your computer created in the folder in which you executed the clone 
command. You should follow the instructions
in the readme to complete the assignment. Then when you
are finished, use the :ref:`git workflow<git_workflow>` to commit your changes
locally and push them to your remote repository on GitHub
where I can access them.

.. note:: Once you are able to use git properly, 
          If you are ever working on an assignment and you have
          an issue and would like my help, you can commit your code 
          changes and push them to
          GitHub. That way, I can
          see what you are working on and where the issue is, and
          even make comments right in your code and you don't have to 
          take a screen shot or attach a file or anything.
