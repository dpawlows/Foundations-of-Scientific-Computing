    "complete conditional statements. The premise behind a conditional statement is we use \n",
    "these tools to change the behavior of our program based on whether or not a condition is met. There are \n",
    "two types of conditional statements: `if` statements and `while` loops. We've already discussed `while` loops \n",

    "statement evaluates to `True` should all be indented. Once indentation stops, program flow is outside of \n",
    "the `if` statement and part of the main body of the code. Let's do an example."
