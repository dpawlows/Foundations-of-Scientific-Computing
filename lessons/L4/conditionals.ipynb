    "complete conditional statements. The premise behind a conditional statement is we use \n",
    "these tools to change the behavior of our program based on whether or not a condition is met. There are \n",
    "two types of conditional statements: `if` statements and `while` loops. We've already discussed `while` loops \n",
    "in a previous lesson. Here we focus on `if` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement\n",
    "----------------\n",

    "The syntax of an `if` statement looks like this:\n",

    "the `if` statement and back of the main body of the code. Let's do an example."
