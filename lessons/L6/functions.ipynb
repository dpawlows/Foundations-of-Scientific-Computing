    "that you want to be printed is in fact printed. Because this is such a common thing to do in programming,\n",
    "there is a built-in function to make it as easy as possible. \n",

In the guts of the `int()` function definition, down in the bowels of the basic functionality of python, there is some code that looks for the keyword \"base\" and if it sees that word in the function definition, it assigns the value that comes after the equal sign to the variable called \"base\" in the definition itself. Since python is watching for a specific keyword, functions that have multiple keywords defined can have keyword arguments passed in any order. We'll revisit this concept shortly.\n",

I only mention this to be completely accurate. But, I think it is better to treat it as if it did not have scope there, as this is typical behavior in other programming languages. Again, examples will be presented in the lesson on user defined functions."
