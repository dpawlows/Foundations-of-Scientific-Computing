Lesson Overview
===============

In this lesson, the focus is on functions: using them, creating them,
and debugging them! As you'll learn, there are three important concepts
that I want you to really understand regarding functions: arguments,
return values, and scope. You'll learn all the details in the following lesson
components:

1. `Understanding the mechanics of functions <functions.ipynb>`_
2. `Learning how to create your own functions <userdefined.ipynb>`_

Learning Goals
--------------

By the end of the week, you should be able to:

  - understand how to call functions.
  - know the different types of arguments.
  - know how to define your own functions.
  - understand how values are passed from the function to the calling program.
  - understand the concept of variable scope.
