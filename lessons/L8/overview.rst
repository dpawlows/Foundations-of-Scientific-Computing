Lesson Overview
===============
This time, we continue to build our plotting toolbox by looking
at how to visualize 2D datasets. In order to make that happen,
we will learn about the array datatype that is part of the numpy
module.


The components of this lesson are:

1. `Working with higher dimensional data with numpy and the numpy array <numpy.ipynb>`_
2. `Plotting 2D datasets <plotting.ipynb>`_

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week, you should be able to

  - Build 2D or 3D (or nD) data structures using Numpy arrays.
  - Perform basic operations on arrays to access important information and manipulate them.
  - Understand how to slice arrays to extract parts of them.
  - Be able to visualize 2D data using contour and surface plots.
  - Understand how to do vector operations on numpy arrays.
