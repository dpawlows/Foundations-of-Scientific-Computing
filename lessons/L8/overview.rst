Lesson Overview
===============

So far, we've learned a lot of the tools that are necessary to
be able to work with data in python. Now we turn to
visualizing the data. In this lesson, we will learn about the
Matplotlib module which enables us to make figures, animations, and other
graphics.

The components of this lesson are:

1. :doc:`An introduction to the Matplotlib library <matplotlib>`
2. `Understanding how to create plots with the pyplot submodule <pyplot.ipynb>`_

After this week, you should be able to

  - understand the anatomy of a figure
  - know how to create a line plot using pyplot
