    "Scatter plots are useful when we want to highlight a correlation between two variables in a dataset. Scatter plots are used differently than line plots, where our function tends \n",
    "to be single valued for all values of the independent variable. Instead, scatter can be used when two variables are independent. As an example, suppose we wanted to see if there was a relationship between the number of days of ice at a particular station on Lake Superior and the mean winter temperature for that season:"
