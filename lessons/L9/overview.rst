Lesson Overview
===============
In this lesson, we will quickly go over a few more
types of plots using pyplot. My goal in
this lesson isn't to make you an expert
in creating every type of plot, but rather
to quickly expose you to those that are used
in physics more commonly. Also, we'll take a
look at a couple useful features of pyplot
that we haven't had a chance to talk about
yet.


The components of this lesson are:

1. `Other useful types of plots in pyplot <other.ipynb>`_
2. `Some more cool features of pyplot <cool.ipynb>`_

Learning Goals
--------------

After this week, you should be able to

  - use a reference to quickly create a variety of plot types
    including log plots, histograms, scatter plots and quiver plots.
  - add latex math to labels and legends on your plots.
  - understand how to add subplots on a figure.
  - create amazing, glorious, plots in XKCD style.
